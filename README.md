This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm run dev
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

===============pending=================
âœ… Next Steps 
Letâ€™s level up your prototype from here:

ðŸ§  1. Add Prompt Engineering Layer
Structure your prompts better based on content comparison, for example:

ts
Copy
Edit
"Compare the following lesson with this benchmark lesson. Highlight key differences in engagement, tone, and structure."
ðŸ“Š 2. Add Loading Skeleton or Spinner
Improve UX while the model is generating the response.

ðŸ’¾ 3. Log API Results
Save prompt and response pairs in local storage or Supabase for:



 show embedded YouTube video and image as part of the rendered result too?
